# Nagios-Cloudstack-
Management of Cloud Stack based Sensor Network using Nagios

Worked under the Prof. Timothy A Gonsalves and customized Nagios to monitor a federated cloud server systems which includes services like ’check-cloud-instances’, 
’check-cloud-capacity’ etc. 
Monitoring and integration of Nagios with the networked and connection-less sensors were accomplished by writing the python and bash scripts.
